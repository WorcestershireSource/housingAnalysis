## Limitations
Date ranges covered by data sets are inconsistent.
Data for the number of 'dwellings' doesn't count no. of bedrooms/persons.
The BoE bank rate is related to, but not the same as, the interest rate offered on mortgages.
All dates have been simplified to use 1 Jan for ease of comparison. 

## Areas for further explaration
What are trends for number of people per household? 
What impact does an aging population have on housing demand? Fewer people per household?
Find data on mortgage rates - have they consistently tracked the base rate?
International comparisons.
