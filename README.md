# UK Housing Market Analysis
A personal project using Python Pandas dataframes, Altair chart plotting and Streamlit to create an interactive tool to explore UK housing market data.

## Limitations
Date ranges covered by data sets are inconsistent.
House prices don't account for the impact of inflation - adjusting to show real prices would be helpful
Data for the number of 'dwellings' doesn't count no. of bedrooms/persons
The BoE bank rate is related to, but not the same as, the interest rate offered on mortgages

## Areas for further explaration
What are trends for number of people per household? 
What impact does an aging population have on housing demand? Fewer people per household?
Accounting for inflation / changes in average wages
Find data on mortgage rates - have they consistently tracked the base rate?
International comparisons
